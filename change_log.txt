/*******************************************************************************
ReferenceFinder 4.x Change Log

20070213 (4.0.1)
-- [RJL, all] Modified RefLine::DistanceTo() to properly handle the case where
a line barely crosses the corner of the square; prior implementation gave
incorrectly small results. Also updated the Help docs to reflect Justin's
discovery of the 7 Huzita axioms.

20061129
-- [RJL, all] Added class RFTextCtrl so that main window responds to both
RETURN and ENTER keys. (Apparently this is only necessary on Mac, but it doesn't
hurt elsewhere.)

20061122
-- [CAF, linux] Added patches to wxGTK2.8.0rc1 to fix (badly) wrong margins
in print and GNOME print preview.
-- [RJL, all] Fixed an error in the documentation about the values of the
constants d and r2.

20061121
-- [CAF, linux] - Added .cache suffix to temporary directory to avoid name
collision.
-- [CAF, all] - fixed error in logic for use of temp directory for help cache

20061118a
-- [RJL, msw] Rearranged the splash screen's appearance during startup to avoid
a crash on MSW. (Ordering on Mac and Linux remains unchanged.) 
-- [RJL, all] Updated About box contents and README files in various places.
-- [CAF, all] Tweaked PS export to use same header as printed output

20061118
-- [RJL, all] Added check on line search to insure user picks distinct points.
-- [RJL, all] Updated the help docs to reflect changes in prefs and menus for
handling page margins.
-- [RJL, msw] Changed VS projects so that RF4 is now statically linked to the
C/C++ runtime libraries.

20061114
-- [RJL, all] Tweaked upward the preset database settings to bump up the accuracy.
-- [RJL, all] Changed help cache file handling so that application can be run
from a read-only volume and we no longer need to build the cache file during
build.
-- [RJL, msw+linux] Tweaked RFFrame.cpp and ReferenceFinder.rc to make icons
available to use for frame and application.

20061113
-- [RJL, all] Small changes for Windows compatibility. Tweak to model because MS
STL doesn't like to compare iterators into different containers (thanks, Shai!).
Cleaned up build directory structure under MSW.

20061111
-- [RJL, all] Numerous changes to bring RF4 into compatibility with wxW-2.7.x.
Reworked the paper scaling to respect page margins from page setup dialog.
Removed separate page margin settings formerly in Preferences. Assorted small
changes in #includes for compatibility with VSEE2005 (Windows).

20060719
-- [RJL, all] Fixed a bug in pagination in class RFPrintout.
-- [CAF, all] Further fixes to parser. Added model/test/test.cpp to code to test
the parser (not needed for console or gui builds of RF4).

20060718
-- [RJL, all] Added settings for page margins, implemented in Print Preview and
printout.
-- [CAF, all] slightly revised parser (essential)
-- [CAF, all] RF4's nonGUI (essential)
-- [CAF, all] ReferenceFinder.h & RFPrefsDialog.* accepting expressions for
paper dimension (optional/experimental). Essentially I added two members to the
prefs data and saved the dimension as strings
-- [RJL, all] Changed RFPrefsDialog parent to gFrame so that menus get properly
updated.
-- [RJL, all] Added display of (textual) paper size to diagrams
-- [RJL, Mac] Patched wxMac so that page setup and print preview work properly.


20060626
-- [RJL, all] Instead of using idle events to update the main frame, I now use
a wxTimer, which works on all platforms (idle was only on Mac).

20060529
-- [RJL, all] Added ReferenceFinder::sLinesWorstCaseError as a user setting.
-- [RJL, all] Tweaked and cleaned up the help files.
-- [CAF, linux] Added linux build files.

20060522
--Fixed a bug in Prefs dialog initialization in which current session values
weren't being used to initialize the panels.
--Moved friend functions GetBoundingBox() in ReferenceFinder.h out of classes
to expose them to the world.
--Bumped up the HTML borders in About box.

20060516
--Initial development release
