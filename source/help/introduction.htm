<h2>Welcome to <em>ReferenceFinder</em>!</h2>
<p>
<em>ReferenceFinder</em> is a tool that helps to construct folding sequences
for origami designs that began life as a crease pattern using techniques like
box-pleating, tree theory, circle/river theory, or polygon packing. In such
designs, the key vertices of the crease are often only defined mathematically
and there is no simple way to construct them by folding.
<em>ReferenceFinder</em> finds short, efficient, and accurate folding sequences
for an arbitrary point (a.k.a. mark) or line on the paper, allowing the origami
artist to construct the crease pattern -- or complete model -- by folding
alone, with no need to measure and/or mark key points.

The documentation is divided up into several sections. Each section can be
printed individually if you'd like to have a hard copy. They are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="background.htm">Background</a> --- gives a little history of this
    program and its relation to the art of origami.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="overview.htm">Overview</a> --- gives a short overview, which
    should be enough to get you started if you don't want to read through the
    entire documentation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="windows.htm">Windows</a> --- describes the major windows of
    <em>ReferenceFinder</em> and what they're used for.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="menus.htm">Menus</a> --- describes the menus and their commands.
  </li>
</ul>

<em>ReferenceFinder 4</em> was written in C++ and developed on Macintosh using
Apple Xcode 2.2 for development and wxWidgets (www.wxwidgets.org) for the GUI.
Contributors include:
<ul>
  <li>Robert J. Lang, main author, Mac and Windows implementation</li>
  <li>Carlos Furuti, expression parser and GNU/Linux implementation</li>
</ul>
Special thanks to Stefan Csomor for wxWidgets-wxMac support, Julian Smart,
Robert Roebling, and Vadim Zeitlin for support (and patience) with incorporating
patches into wxW printing, and to Shai Seger, Giro, and Wlodzimierz 'ABX' Skiba
for assistance with the Windows port.
