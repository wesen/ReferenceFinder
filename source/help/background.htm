<h2>Genesis of the Problem</h2>
<p>
For most of the multi-hundred-year history of origami, new designs were most
likely created by hands-on experimentation and they were passed down through
the years by direct teaching, one person to another. Both of these traits led
to the notion of origami as a sequential process; you began with an unmarked
square and then built up the origami figure, making one or at most, a few folds
at any one time. For all but the last few steps, every fold could be precisely,
almost mathematically defined: "bring this corner to that corner;" "fold the
edge up to the crease;" and so forth. Trial-and-error folding experimentation
leads naturally to a step-by-step folding sequence; the harsh evolutionary
pressure of teachability insured that in an era of word-of-mouth teaching, any
origami design that didn't have a precise construction for critical reference
points didn't survive.
</p>
<p>
But the modern era of origami -- which dates roughly from the 1950s onward --
saw two changes that were to revolutionize the art. First, Akira Yoshiazawa's
notation for origami instruction became widely accepted, leading to an era of
sharing of concepts and techniques that continues to this day. Second, early
pioneers like Neal Elias began to create origami designs using a paradigm of
"fitting all the parts" into the crease pattern, so that key folds were no
longer defined by a sequence of folding steps, but instead were defined by
potentially complex conditions that applied to the entire crease pattern. Any
given vertex or crease could have its location defined with mathematical
precision, but that definition was now entirely divorced from the folding
sequence, if any, that led to its construction.
</p>
<p>
Elias, Max Hulme, Emmanuel Mooser, and other practitioners of this early form
of design used a technique called <em>box-pleating</em>, in which nearly all
creases ran either vertically or horizontally on a regular grid of squares.
This allowed a work-around method of folding: one could crease the paper
lightly into the complete grid of squares (typically 16x16 or 24x24), then go
back and make sharp the particular grid creases needed for the crease pattern,
and, where necessary, add diagonal creases cutting across grid squares. This
approach had the unfortunate side effect of leaving the crease grid behind on
the finished fold, but it preserved something that had become very important in
origami: the ability to construct the entire figure by folding alone, i.e.,
without having to measure and/or mark points, which was (and still is)
perceived as a weakness in the foldability of an origami figure.
</p>
<p>
Alas, more was to come. Beginning in the 1960s, American artist John
Montroll began to design animals and other origami figures at a high level of
complexity. Like the box-pleaters, he designed the entire model before he ever
began folding, so that he could insure that all of the needed "parts" fit
within the square. Unlike the box-pleaters, Montroll utilized a wide variety of
symmetries and structures within his designs, particularly those based on the
angle 22.5 degrees (obtained by dividing a full circle into 16ths). In
Montroll's designs, key creases and vertices -- called <em>references</em> --
could still be defined with mathematical precision, but their mathematical
definition could be algebraically much more complex. Instead of being located,
say, 1/16 of the way across the square (as might happen in box-pleating), in
Montroll's designs -- and the designs of those who followed -- a key vertex
might be located at something like 1/(1+2*sqrt(2)) of the way across the square
-- or worse.
</p>
<p>
There were usually work-arounds, however. Most of the time, one could identify
one or two of these "irregular" vertices as the "key" vertices from which, once
located, all others could be derived by folding. Thus, the origami diagrammer
only had to find a folding sequence for a single point. By trying various
combinations of folds, one could eventually find a set of folds that came
reasonably close to the desired point. Or by careful algebraic analysis, once
could create a geometric construction (analogous to compass-and-straightedge
construction) that eventually led to the key reference. And from that one key
reference, all the rest could be derived.
</p>
<p>
This happy status began to fall completely apart in the 1990s, however,
with the development of circle/river theory and tree theory -- mathematical
techniques for origami design that resulted in not just one or two irregular
key vertices, but tens, or even hundreds of vertices that were, at best,
defined by complex sets of algebraic equations, and in some cases, could only
be solved-for numerically. These sophisticated origami design techniques made it
possible to design figures of seemingly boundless complexity; but
paradoxically, the very process that made it possible to <em>design</em> such
figures also led to crease patterns that seemed impossible to fold -- at least,
without measuring and marking a host of points and lines on the paper -- or,
its modern equivalent, printing out the crease pattern from a computer.
</p>
<p>
This problem with circle-packed designs continues to this day, and has in fact
insured the continued utilization of box-pleating for some of the most complex
origami designs; they may not be as efficient as circle-packed designs, but
they are at least potentially foldable without calculator, ruler, pencil,
and/or laser printer.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, a remedy was in the offing. While the mathematicization of origami
had led to a brand-new problem that afflicted nearly all of the most complex
origami designs, within mathematics lay also the seeds of a solution.
</p>

<h2>Hatori Axioms</h2>
<p>
In the proceedings of the <em>First International Meeting of Origami Science
and Technology</em>, Humiaki Huzita and Benedetto Scimemi presented a paper,
"The Algebra of Paper-Folding (Origami)", in which they identified six
distinctly different ways one could create a single crease by aligning one or
more combinations of points and lines (i.e., existing creases) on a sheet of
paper. Those six operations became known as the <em>Huzita axioms</em>. The
Huzita axioms provided the first formal description of what types of geometric
constructions were possible with origami: in a nutshell, quite a lot was
possible! The six axioms are shown below.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="background_huzita.jpg" alt=""><br>
  <b>Figure B-1</b>.  The six Huzita axioms.
</p>
<p>
It has been shown that using the six Huzita axioms, it is possible to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solve all quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations with rational coefficients;</li>
  <li>Trisect an arbitrary angle;</li>
  <li>Construct cube roots, including the famous problem of "doubling the cube";</li>
  <li>Construct a regular N-gon for N of the form 
<!--  2<sup>i</sup>3<sup>j</sup>(2<sup>k</sup>3<sup>l</sup>+1)  -->
  (2^i)(3^j)((2^k)(3^l)+1)
  when the last
  term in parentheses is a prime (a so-called Pierpont Prime);</li>
</ul>
<p>
Huzita's axioms formed the bedrock of the study of origami geometric
constructions for many years. Thus, it came as something of a shock to learn in
2002 that we all had missed one! Japanese folder Koshiro Hatori had, in his own
investigations, found a type of single-fold alignment that could not be
described in terms of any of the six Huzita axioms. In other words: there was a
seventh axiom.
<p align="center">
  <img src="background_hatori.jpg" alt=""><br>
  <b>Figure B-2. </b>Hatori's 7th axiom.
</p>
<p>
Hatori describes his discovery on his web site,
http://origami.ousaan.com/library/conste.html. This discovery of course raised
the question: are there any more axioms out there? And the answer appears to be
"no". I [RJL] subsequently performed a complete enumeration of all possible
alignments that specify a single crease, and all feasible constructions
correspond to one of the seven axioms. In fact, it turns out that Jacques Justin
had actually identified all seven axioms in his French-language OST paper
-- a fact that many of us (myself included) overlooked for many years (due,
perhaps in part, to the rarity of the proceedings). By this time, the name
<em>Huzita axioms</em> had come into use for the original six; and the group of
seven became known as the <em>Huzita-Hatori</em> axioms. (Although it now
appears that calling them the <em>Huzita-Justin</em> axioms, or even
<em>Justin-Huzita</em> axioms, might better reflect their original discovery.)
</p>
<p>
At any rate, it turns out that the new axiom doesn't allow the solution of any
higher-order equations than the original six Huzita axioms. But it's nice to
have the complete set.
</p>
<p>  
Within the mathematical theory of origami geometric constructions, the seven
Huzita-Hatori axioms define what is possible to construct by making sequential
single creases formed by aligning combinations of points and lines. The
question then arises: is it possible to solve higher-order equations by
combinations of alignments that define <em>more than one</em> simultaneous
crease? The answer is yes, and this is now an area of active research by many
origami mathematicians. There are, in fact, hundreds of "axioms" equivalent to
the Huzita-Hatori axioms (the exact number depends on what you consider
"equivalent" axioms) considering pairs of simultaneous creases. But the
7 HH axioms are all easily performed, and, thanks to the analysis of
mathematicians, it is known how to combine them to construct points and/or
lines that are solutions of any equation up to quartic. 
</p>

<h2>Exact, or Approximate?</h2>
<p>
That is, the HH axioms can be used to construct <em>exact</em> solutions to
quartic equations -- or at least as exact as the reality of folding (and the
imperfections of both the paper and the human folder) will allow. But not all
points and lines in a mathematical origami design can be described by quartic
equations; some are the solutions of trigonometric relations, higher-order
polynomials, or even sets of mixed trigonometric and polynomial equations.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, figuring out what equations can be solved by HH axioms is a
<em>mathematical</em> problem, but finding a folding sequence for a reference
point or line is a <em>practical</em> problem. We really shouldn't care whether
a folding sequence is mathematically exact or not, so long as we can't tell the
difference in the folded shape. That means that no matter what the exact
reference point is, a folding sequence that gives an approximate solution
should be perfectly adequate, so long as the approximation is "close enough."
</p>
<p>
And conversely, even a mathematically exact construction of a reference point
might be highly undesirable, if the folding sequence is long and torturous, or
if it involves maneuvers that are inherently difficult to make with precision
-- an example being folding a long, skinny triangular corner. (Try it.) The
qualities that make a good reference folding sequence include accuracy, but
they include other things as well: the folding sequence should be short, and it
should not include inherently imprecise folds.
</p>
<p>
With that in mind, let's turn to the HH axioms and what we can do with them.
Every HH axiom brings together combinations of preexisting lines and points.
Lines are typically creases. Points can only be defined in one way: as the
intersection of two lines. But what do we start with? An unmarked square. An
unmarked square has no creases.
</p>
<p>
But it does have lines: four of them. The raw edges of the paper define four
lines to start with. Similarly, the four corners of the square define four
points. These 8 references, then, are the initial references from which all
others must be constructed.
</p>
<p>
Starting with these four lines and creases, we can look at what is possible
with the 7 HH axioms. And the answer is: not much, at least with only one.
Figure B-3 shows the possibilities. Essentially, you can fold the paper in half
in one of four different ways, creating four new lines. Two of those lines --
the vertical and horizontal -- hit the existing edges, creating four new
points. And if we consider all of the lines possible with a single fold, any
pair of them creates a fifth new point -- in the very center of the square. And
some of the axioms are not even possible from this small set of starting
references.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="background_oneaxiom.png" alt=""><br>
  <b>Figure B-3. </b>The lines and marks that can be created in an unmarked
  square by each of the HH axioms.
</p>
<p>
But now, we have a total of eight lines and nine points, and we can repeat the
process. Taking all possible combinations of these 17 references gives 32 total
lines and -- carefully counting -- 129 total points. And the results grow very
rapidly from there -- in fact, exponentially. Just a few more iterations puts
the numbers of lines and points well into the millions.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="background_threeaxioms.png" alt=""><br>
  <b>Figure B-4. </b>The lines and marks that can be created in an unmarked
  square by repeated application of the HH axioms.
</p>
<p>
And that's where the approximations come in. Each point or line in the square
is the result of a unique sequence of HH axioms. If (as is the case) after 6 or
so iterations, there are a million distinct points in the square, then there
are a million sequences of HH axioms, each of which gives a distinct point
somewhere in the square.
</p>
<p>
With a million points distributed throughout the square, if you pick
<em>any</em> point in the square, odds are that one of those million sequences
creates a point that lands very close by. Very close indeed. With a million
evenly-spaced points, the odds are that the distance to the nearest HH-sequence
point is less than one part in two thousand -- 0.0005 -- of the side of the
square. As a practical matter, it is difficult to make any fold in a square
much more precise than that. (Try it: in a standard 25 cm square, an error of
.0005 is about two hair widths.) The points creatable by HH axiom sequences are
not perfectly uniformly distributed, but they are distributed well enough that
for any random point there is a HH-sequence point nearby.
</p>
<p>
But with a million possible points and folding sequences, how do we find the
combination that best matches our desired target? That's where
<em>ReferenceFinder</em> comes in. Computers are extremely good at a couple of
things: mathematical calculations, and sifting through databases are near the
top of the list. <em>ReferenceFinder</em> simply calculates <em>all</em>
possible sequences up to a specified level of complexity. Then, when you ask
for a particular point or line, it quickly (almost instaneously) sorts through
the list to find the one closest to the point or line that you are seeking.
