<!--========================================================================-->
<h2><a name="App">Application Menu</a></h2>

<h3>Application->About ReferenceFinder...</h3>
<p>
Puts up a dialog box that displays brief information about the program, the
version, and the terms of usage.
</p>
<p>
This box shows up the first time you run the application after the splash
screen; a checkbox lets you turn off its display thereafter.
</p>
<p>
The <b>About ReferenceFinder...</b> command shows up under the <b>Help</b> menu
on non-Mac platforms.
</p>
<h3>Application->Preferences</h3>
<p>
Sets application-wide preferences for <em>ReferenceFinder</em>. See the
<a href="windows.htm#Preferences">Preferences Window</a> for a detailed
description of the contents and their function.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Preferences</b> command shows up under the <b>File</b> menu on non-Mac
platforms.
</p>

<h3>Application->Quit</h3>
<p>
Exit the program. You can quit even if a calculation (database rebuild
or statistical analysis) is in progress.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Quit</b> command shows up under the <b>File</b> menu and is called
<b>Exit</b> on non-Mac platforms.
</p>




<!-- ========================================================================= -->
<h2><a name="File">File Menu</a></h2>

<h3>File->Export PostScript...</h3>
<p>
Exports a text file containing PostScript code that prints the diagrams. Due
to differences between screen layout and printing settings, the diagram layout 
in the PostScript file will not exactly match the screen display and/or printouts.
</p>

<h3>File->Print...</h3>
<p>
Print the currently-displayed references. The printout will be scaled to the
full width of the page, with page breaks, if needed, between folding sequences.
</p>

<h3>File->Page Margins...</h3>
<p>
Lets you choose the margins for printing. This item is only present on
Macintosh, as on other platforms you can set the margins in the Print Setup...
dialog.
</p>

<h3>File->Print Setup...</h3>
<p>
Set up the page for printing.
</p>

<h3>File->Print Preview...</h3>
<p>
Preview the print image before printing.
</p>




<!-- ========================================================================= -->
<h2><a name="Edit">Edit Menu</a></h2>

<h3>Edit->Undo</h3>
<p>
Undo the last modification in a text box.
</p>

<h3>Edit->Cut</h3>
<p>
Cut the current text selection.
</p>

<h3>Edit->Copy</h3>
<p>
Copy the current text selection.
</p>

<h3>Edit->Paste</h3>
<p>
Paste the current text selection.
</p>

<h3>Edit->Clear</h3>
<p>
Delete the current text selection.
</p>



<!--=========================================================================-->
<h2><a name="Action">Action Menu</a></h2>

<h3>Action->Seek Marks/Lines</h3>
<p>
Toggle the radio button in the main window between seeking marks and lines.
Using the mouse, it's probably quicker and easier to just click on the radio
button itself, but this menu item serves as a reminder of the quickest way to
toggle between the two: type command-T (control-T on non-Mac platforms).
</p>

<h3>Action->Get References</h3>
<p>
Find a set of folding sequences for the reference (point or line) in the main
window. This command is automatically performed if you hit the Return or Enter
key while typing in one of the text boxes of the main window.
</p>

<h3>Action->Clear References</h3>
<p>
Clear the currently-displayed folding sequences. This is useful if you want to
keep <em>ReferenceFinder</em> around on-screen at its minimum size.
</p>

<h3>Action->Rebuild Database</h3>
<p>
Begin reconstructing the database of marks and lines. Normally you will
not need to execute this command -- database rebuild happens automatically when
you apply changes to the database settings in the Preferences window -- but if
you halted database reconstruction for some reason, you can restart it with
this command.
</p>

<h3>Action->Calculate Statistics</h3>
<p>
Perform a statistical analysis of the database. This command performs a series
of trials, picking random points within the paper, finding the folding sequence
that gives the closest mark, and then computing the error between the two. The
resulting error is binned. At the end of the analysis, the results are display
in two ways: first, the percentage of trials that gave error less than a given
amount; second, the error at various percentiles. The results are shown in the
main window, however, they are not printable. 
</p>
<p>
This command is useful primarily for comparing the performance of different
database settings; you will not ordinarily use it.
</p>

<h3>Action->Halt Calculation</h3>
<p>
If the database is under construction, this command is displayed as <b>Halt
Rebuild Database</b> and halts the construction of the database. The database
will be left in a usable state, but only with those marks and lines calculated
so far.
</p>
<p>
If a statistical analysis is in progress, this command is displayed as <b>Halt
Calculate Statistics</b> and halts the analysis. Results will be reported based
on the trials accumulated so far.
</p>
