<h1 align="center"><em>Overview</em></h1>

<p>
This page gives a brief overview of <em>ReferenceFinder</em> to get you
started. The screen images shown are from the Macintosh version of
<em>ReferenceFinder</em>, but windows on other platforms should look similar.
</p>
<p>
When <em>ReferenceFinder</em> first starts up, it will display its main window
while it constructs its database of points and lines. This initialization will
take a few seconds to a few minutes (depending on the speed and memory of your
machine), but <em>ReferenceFinder</em> will regularly update the progress as it
works.
</p>

</p>
When initialization is complete, <em>ReferenceFinder</em> will display "Ready"
and the number of points (marks) and lines that it has constructed in
preparation for your search.

</p>
<p>
The main window contains a few controls that let you choose what you are
looking for. The two radio buttons, <b>Point</b> and <b>Line</b>, select
whether you're seeking to create a point or a fold line. If you select
<b>Point</b>, you will enter the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates of the
point in the adjacent text boxes. If you select <b>Line</b>, then you will need
to enter <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for two distinct points along
the line.
</p>
<p>
The default paper size is a unit square, so all coordinates values should be
between 0 and 1. (You can change the paper size in the Preferences if, for
example, you're using A4 paper.) You can enter coordinates either as their
decimal values (e.g., 0.4142), or as a mathematical expression (e.g.,
sqrt(2)-1, or even d-1). Expressions may contain any of the operators +, -, *,
/, ^, (), sqrt, sin, cos, tan, deg2rad and constants e, pi, phi, Phi, and d,
which is an abbreviation for sqrt(2) (which shows up a lot in origami crease
patterns). Trigonometric functions use radians. Function deg2rad converts
degrees to radians. If you enter an expression that <em>ReferenceFinder</em>
can't interpret, or that interprets to a point outside the paper,
<em>ReferenceFinder</em> will let you know so that you can take corrective
action.
</p>
<p>
Once you have entered the coordinate values for one or two points, you can
select <b>Action->Get Reference</b> or simply hit the Return or Enter key.
<em>ReferenceFinder</em> immediately finds several folding sequences that give
the desired point or line and displays folding diagrams and verbal directions
for them in the window. At this point, the <b>File->Print...</b> command will
be enabled, and you can print the resulting diagrams for a permanent record.
</p>

</p>
<p>
For each sequence, <em>ReferenceFinder</em> displays the error between the
displayed sequence and your chosen target, and the <em>rank</em>, which is the
number of folds needed to create the mark or line from a blank paper. Sequences
with smaller rank are shown first; within a given rank, the lowest error is
shown first.
</p>
<p>
That's all there is to it. If you want to find another point or line, enter new
coordinates and hit Return.
</p>
<p>
There are several settings you can adjust within <em>ReferenceFinder</em> that
affect the screen display and the database of references; these let you
set the paper dimensions, trade off initialization time against accuracy, and
even choose which of the Huzita-Hatori axioms to use in constructing
references. All of these settings are accessible through the Preferences
command, which is described later in this documentation. At any point, you can
refer to the Help menu for explanations of menu commands, windows, and
possible actions.
