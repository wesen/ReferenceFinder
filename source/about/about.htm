<em>ReferenceFinder</em> is a tool for origami design that finds short,
efficient, and accurate folding sequences for constructing an arbitrary point
or line within a rectangular sheet of paper. Using <em>ReferenceFinder</em>,
you can create all of the reference points needed to construct an origami
design by folding alone.
</p>
<p>
<em>ReferenceFinder 4</em> was written in C++ and developed on Macintosh using
Apple Xcode 2.2 for development and wxWidgets (www.wxwidgets.org) for the GUI.
Contributors include:
<ul>
  <li>Robert J. Lang, main author, Mac and Windows implementation</li>
  <li>Carlos Furuti, expression parser and GNU/Linux implementation</li>
</ul>
Special thanks to Stefan Csomor for wxWidgets-wxMac support, Julian Smart,
Robert Roebling, and Vadim Zeitlin for support (and patience) with incorporating
patches into wxW printing, and to Shai Seger, Giro, and Wlodzimierz 'ABX' Skiba
for assistance with the Windows port.
